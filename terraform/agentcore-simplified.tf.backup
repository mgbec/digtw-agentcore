# Backup of original agentcore.tf
# This is a simplified version that removes potentially problematic resources

# If you're getting errors with Bedrock Agents, it might be because:
# 1. Bedrock Agents API is very new and may not be fully supported in Terraform AWS provider
# 2. Your AWS account may not have Bedrock Agents enabled
# 3. The region may not support Bedrock Agents yet

# RECOMMENDATION: Start with the traditional backend first, then add Agentcore later
# when AWS provider support is more mature.

# To disable Agentcore deployment:
# 1. Rename agentcore.tf to agentcore.tf.disabled
# 2. Run: terraform apply
# 3. This will deploy only the traditional backend

# The traditional backend works perfectly and has all the features you need!
